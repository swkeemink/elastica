# elastica
Code for Keemink & van Rossum (2015) - A unified account of tilt illusions, association fields, and contour detection based on elastica

See the Elastica Basics notebook for simple elastica explanations.

See the Elastica Paper notebook for how to use the scripts to reproduce some things from the paper. 

The plotting in the notebooks is done using the Holoviews toolbox: http://ioam.github.io/holoviews/
To be able to see the animations made with the toolbox, open the html pages of the notebooks.
